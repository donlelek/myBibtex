# myBibtex
A bibtex file with curated references I frequently use.

Based on [this post](http://serialmentor.com/blog/2015/10/2/Bibtex), I modified my references accordingly. I put special attention into avoiding the following mistakes:

- Incorrectly capitalized article titles (protect capital letters with curly braces)
- Incorrectly abbreviated first names and missing middle initials (replaced first and middle names with their initial followed by a period)
- Inconsistent journal names (looked for proper abbreviations and added periods after abbreviated words)
- Superfluous issue numbers, publication months, or other elements (for article I only kept the `title`, `author`, `journal`, `volume`, `pages`, `year`, and `doi` fields)

Additionally, I replaced all special characters with their latex-code, thus an `é` became `\{'e}` and an `ø` became `\{\o}` and so on.
